jsBIH

A Bounding-Interval Heirarchy library in pure javascript. No dependancies.

!!NOTE!!

There are two jsBIH libraries right now. The original, fully functional, and 
test-passing library is "jsbih.js". 

The file "jsbih_new.js" is an experimental version (that currently lacks proper
remove() support) that supports more than one object per leaf.
